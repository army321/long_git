Thank you for contributing!! :gem:

# Philosophy :cyclone:

Ryven is meant to be a **simple**, **transparent**, and **unrestricted** tool for visual scripting in Python.
It does not intend to replace textual source code by the diagram representation, but rather to enhance it.
Any form of optimization shall only be considered if it does not really restrict or significantly complicate
the functionality of the software.

# Contributions in general :rocket:

There are many different ways you can contribute to the Ryven project.
The most effective one of doing so is by creating content (nodes and projects).
Furthermore, if you have expertise in Python development, particularly regarding Qt,
feel free to rework and enhance specific parts of the software. If it doesn't violate the philosophy,
I will be happy to seaminglessly integrate as much as possible of that into future releases.
You can find a list of ideas and TODOs you might be more capable of than I am in the README.

# Creating good issues :mega:

- please check the [information on the website](https://ryven.org/guides) before you open a new issue
- if it's an issue about the software, make sure to always include a precise desctiption of the problem
- feel free to open issues also for suggestions and discussions around possible improvements

Have a great day!
